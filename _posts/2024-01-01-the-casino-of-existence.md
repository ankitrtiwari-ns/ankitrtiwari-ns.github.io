title: "The Casino of Existence"

Never did we ask to enter, but one day we find ourselves inside. The doors close behind us, welcome to the great casino. A thousand tables glowing, dealers smiling with fixed grins, the endless shuffle of cards. In our hands, a stack of chips called life.

The rules? No one explains them. The tables running, the dice rolling. All you can do? sit and play. Every choice becomes a bet, every day another round.

It starts fair enough. You give something, you get something. Work buys you money, effort earns you reward, affection is met with affection. The trade feels balanced. You lose some, win some, and the game feels worth playing.

But balance is an illusion, a trick to keep you playing.

Soon you learn that some deals don’t payout. You pour years into a dream that collapses. You love someone who cannot return it. You promise permanence in a world that runs on transiency. These debts don’t disappear; they linger like ghosts, haunting you as you play.

The casino doesn't care about unfinished deals, you do.

And then comes the scam. The obvious swindles. The house rigging the game. The system that asks for sacrifice but never delivers security. The people who swear loyalty but vanish when the hand turns.

The strange part: you know we’re being played, and yet you lean in. Because deep down, we enjoy being cheated. The illusion excites us, the spectacle dazzles us. If the game were purely fair, it would also be unbearably dull. The thrill is in the trick itself.

This is where the real paradox appears. You see through it. You know the house always wins. You know your chips, no matter how carefully played, will be swept away in the end. And yet — you keep playing.

Why? Because the alternative isn’t freedom. There is no walking away from the table. The casino is existence itself. Refusing to play is still playing. The only choice, how to play?

To play lucidly is to laugh while betting chips you know you’ll never keep. It is to take the con with a grin and hope for the best. It is to treat every round as theater.

Time is the dealer that never sleeps. Slowly, steadily, it rakes in your chips. The debts, the winnings, the secrets you hide — all returns to the endless void.

And so yes, the casino is rigged. The house always wins. But maybe winning was never the point. Maybe the beauty lies in how we play, how we bluff, how we laugh as the chips lay.

So—how do you want to lose?
